# Houser

*Houser is rental management system where property owners can manage which properties they're renting out and tenants can access their landlord's contact information using their respective portals.*

Deployed version can be found [Here]()

 ## How to use this site:
1. On the startup page, you will be greeted with a moving homescreen. This will be the only page you see unless you login.
2. Users will be able to login or signup at the top right. Once clicked, put in the respective information. If the user is a renter, they will be directed to a renter's portal. If they click the Landlord button, they will be directed to the owner portal.
3. In the rental portal, users will be able to edit their information, contact their landlord, and have a reminder to pay rent. Renters will only have one house connected with their login!
4. In the owner portal, owners will have access to as many properties as they need. They will be able to see all their owned homes and who is renting from each home. Owners are also able to edit their contact information to keep their tenants up to date!
5. This site also allows users to logout and return to the site to login whenever they would like!

# Houser

*Houser is rental management system where property owners can manage which properties they're renting out and tenants can access their landlord's contact information using their respective portals.*

Deployed version can be found [Here]()

 ## How to use this site:
1. On the startup page, you will be greeted with a moving homescreen. This will be the only page you see unless you login.
2. Users will be able to login or signup at the top right. Once clicked, put in the respective information. If the user is a renter, they will be directed to a renter's portal. If they click the Landlord button, they will be directed to the owner portal.
3. In the rental portal, users will be able to edit their information, contact their landlord, and have a reminder to pay rent. Renters will only have one house connected with their login!
4. In the owner portal, owners will have access to as many properties as they need. They will be able to see all their owned homes and who is renting from each home. Owners are also able to edit their contact information to keep their tenants up to date!
5. This site also allows users to logout and return to the site to login whenever they would like!

## Indepth Analysis

For this project, we wanted to create a seamless management system for two types of users: renters and owners. Typically, when someone rents from a homeowner, they will send them rent to their personal accounts or they will have to login to an association portal to pay their rent- which is fine in theory. However, with this site, users can find their home information, whether they own it or are renting. Not only that, they can keep their contact information up to date in order to communicate with one another more efficiently. 

So how did this come alive? We, as The HOA Association, came together to creat a MERN Stack Application. This means our application uses MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. We created two main folders, a client side and a server side, in order to execute their functionalities together. On the client side, we focuse on the components, styling, and other utilities that built the site using aspects of the server side. On the server side, we made sure to complete our queriies, models, authorization, shemas, and seeds which would allow data to connect to the client side of the application.
